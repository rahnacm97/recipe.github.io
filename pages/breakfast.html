                <h2>Puttu</h2>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rice flour (Puttu podi) – 2 cups</li>
                    <li>Grated coconut – 1 cup</li>
                    <li>Water – 1 cup (approx.)</li>
                    <li>Salt – to taste</li>
                   
                </ul>
                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the Rice Flour:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take the rice flour in a large mixing bowl.</li>
                        <li>Add a pinch of salt to the flour.</li>
                        <li>Gradually sprinkle water into the flour and mix with your hands. 
                            The flour should be moist but not form a dough. The consistency should be crumbly, 
                            like wet sand. 
                            To check, take a little flour and press it; 
                            it should hold its shape and then crumble when you touch it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Layering the Puttu:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a puttu maker (cylindrical steamer) for this step.
                             If you don’t have one, you can use a coconut shell or any small steamer.</li>
                        <li>Start by adding a thin layer of grated coconut at the bottom of the puttu maker.</li>
                        <li>Then, add a layer of the moistened rice flour on top of the coconut. 
                            Don’t press it down; just let it fall in loosely.</li>
                        <li>Add another layer of grated coconut, followed by the rice flour. 
                            Repeat this process until the puttu maker is full, finishing with a 
                            layer of grated coconut</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Steaming:</li>
                    <ul>
                       <li>Assemble the puttu maker and attach it to the pressure cooker or a pot with boiling water.</li>
                       <li>Steam the puttu for about 5-7 minutes until the steam starts coming out of the top, 
                        and the rice flour is cooked.</li>
                       <li>Once done, carefully remove the puttu from the maker using the stick provided. 
                            Push it out onto a plate.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <li>Serving:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Serve hot with kadala curry (black chickpeas curry), banana, 
                            or any side dish of your choice.</li>

                        Transfer this to a large bowl.</li>
                    <li>Next, drain the rice and grind it to a slightly coarse batter, adding water as needed. 
                        The rice batter should be slightly grainy but not too coarse. 
                        Mix the rice batter with the urad dal batter.</li>

                        The batter should be of pouring consistency but thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl with a lid and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight. 
                        The batter will double in size during fermentation.</li>

                    <li>Pour the batter into the molds, filling them about ¾ full.</li>
                    <li>Heat water in an idli steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle) 
                        and place the idli stand inside.</li>
                    <li>Steam the idlis on medium heat for 10-12 minutes. Check for doneness by inserting a 
                        toothpick or knife; it should come out clean.</li>

            <li>Cover the pan with a lid and cook on low to medium heat for 
                2-3 minutes until the appam is cooked through, the edges are crispy, and the center 
                is soft and fluffy.</li>

            <li>Chana dal (split chickpeas) – 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Cashew nuts – 8-10 (optional)</li>
            <li>Water – 2½ cups</li>
            <li>Ghee or oil – 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Salt – to taste</li>
            <li>Coriander leaves – for garnish (optional) </li>         
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roasting the Semolina:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat a pan on medium heat and dry roast the semolina until it turns 
                    light golden and gives off a nutty aroma. Stir continuously to avoid burning.</li>
                <li>Once roasted, transfer the semolina to a plate and set it aside.</li> 
            </ul>
            <li>Tempering:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In the same pan, heat ghee or oil on medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.</li>   
                <li> Add urad dal, chana dal, and cashew nuts, and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>   
                <li>Add curry leaves, green chilies, and chopped ginger. 
                    Sauté for a minute until the ginger is aromatic.</li>    
                <li>Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>    
            </ul>
            <li>Cooking the Upma:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pour 2½ cups of water into the pan, add salt to taste, and bring the water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once the water starts boiling, gradually add the roasted semolina while stirring 
                    continuously to prevent lumps from forming.</li>   
                <li>Lower the heat and cook the upma until the semolina absorbs all the water and 
                    becomes soft and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.</li>   
                <li>Cover the pan and let the upma steam on low heat for a minute or two.</li>   
            </ul>
                <li>Serving:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fluff the upma with a fork, garnish with chopped coriander 
                        leaves if desired, and serve hot.</li>
                    <li>Upma is traditionally served with coconut chutney, pickle, 
                        or a side of your choice. </li>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preparing the Dough:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boil 2 cups of water in a saucepan. Add salt and coconut oil (if using).</li>
                        <li>Gradually add the rice flour to the boiling water, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</li>    
                        <li>Once the flour is added, remove the saucepan from heat and mix the dough until 
                            it comes together.</li>    
                        <li>Let the dough cool slightly until it is warm enough to handle.

                    </ul>
                    <li>Rolling the Pathiri:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls.</li>
                        <li>Dust a clean surface with a little rice flour. Take a dough ball and 
                            roll it out into a thin, round disc using a rolling pin. The pathiri 
                            should be very thin, about 2-3 mm in thickness.</li>    
                        <li>Alternatively, you can press the dough ball between two 
                            sheets of plastic or parchment paper using a flat plate or a pathiri press. </li>           
                    </ul>
                    <li>Cooking the Pathiri:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Heat a tawa (flat griddle) on medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Place the rolled pathiri on the hot tawa. Cook for a 
                            few seconds until bubbles start to form on the surface.</li>    
                        <li>Flip the pathiri and cook the other side. The pathiri 
                            should puff up slightly, and you can gently press the edges with a 
                            spatula to help it puff.</li>    
                        <li>Cook until both sides have light golden spots and are fully cooked. 
                            Do not overcook, as pathiris are meant to be soft.</li>        
                    </ul>

                            <li>Remove the pathiri from the tawa and place it in a container with 
                                a lid to keep it soft and warm.</li>

                                mutton curry, or vegetable stew. Pathiri pairs especially well with spicy curries.</li>
